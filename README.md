## About The Project

This project is an Interactive Python-based data augmentation tool that applies affine transformations to an image dataset. It augments the dataset by applying geometric transformations such as flipping, rotation, shifting, and more. The augmented dataset can be used for various machine learning and image processing tasks, improving the generalization of models.

## Specifications

The goal of the machine problem is to apply the concepts of affine transformations, specifically using geometric transformations. You are to submit two files for this activity: 
1. a Jupyter notebook containing the solutions to the action items. Ensure you provide comments, discussions, and proper section divisions for your code. Please also include your answer to the Guide Questions in the Jupyter Notebook; 
2. a PDF version of your Jupyter Notebook.

You can provide a link to your submission resources or a zip file. The instructor will run it on their local machine, so make sure the codes and files are accessible and functional. 

## Action items
### [Data Formatting] Given the image datasetLinks to an external site.:
- [X] Reshape the images to (100,100,3)
- [X] Save the transformed images as JPEG files in a separate directory.

### [Data Augmentation] Given the previous dataset:

Create individual parametrized functions that can:
- [X] Randomly put a black patch over a portion of the image
- [X] Shift an image sideward or upwards.
- [X] Rotate an image either for
- [X] Flip an image either vertically or horizontally.
- [X] Produce a new augmented dataset with at least 100 images (original images included) using the functions made in the previous action item.

### Guide Questions:
1. Define Data Augmentation and discuss its importance and the importance of understanding digital image processing for such an activity.
2. What other data augmentation techniques are applicable and not applicable to the dataset you have produced? Why?
